UI prototype demonstrating the idea of toggling plug-ins on/off and accessing them through a contextual pop-up menu: https://catherinesyeh.github.io/pdf-demo/

Users can explore how **(a)** toggling the unit conversion plug-in affects the PDF reader and how **(b)** the plug-in tooltip only shows up if relevant text for unit conversion is selected. **(c)** The simulated interface's zoom and full screen settings can also be adjusted just like a real PDF reader.
